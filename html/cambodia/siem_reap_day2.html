        Our second day in Siem Reap started <u>super</u> early! We signed up for
        a sunrise tour of the "small circuit" of the Angkor Wat temple complex
        and had to be dressed and ready to go by 4:30am.

      <div class="page-content-text">
        Before the sun was up, we got into a tuk-tuk for a short ride to the
        ticket office and then the temple complex.

        We met our guide for the day and learned that we would be starting the
        tour with the main temple, Angkor Wat. So we crossed a cool floating
        bridge to the temple and staked out a good location to see the sun rise
        over the temple.

        After learning a little about the temple from our guide, we took some

        some steep steps to get a great view from the top.

        Because it's the wet season here and definitely not peak tourist season,

        could visit the temple, though, we were dropped off at an overpriced
        restaurant nearby and had to wait an hour while other people on our tour
        ordered full meals. This reminded Dylan why he doesn't like tours...

        This is the "Angelina Jolie" tree near the center of the temple. In the
        movie, she ran all across the top of the temple and then swung from a

        looked really cool!

        Once our tour ended, we headed back to Pub Street for some food. A lot
        of the restaurants here serve wood fire pizzas, so we decided to try
        one. Fresh pineapple on pizza was quite tasty...and we had a second
        course of Khmer curry to keep things authentic!
