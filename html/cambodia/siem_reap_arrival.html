        We got up pretty early to catch a flight to Cambodia. It was a short
        flight and a very small airplane!

        From the airport, we took a quick cab ride to where we are staying. The
        place, Onederz, is a hostel that also has some private rooms. It's
        turned out to be really fun to get the backpacker/hostel environment
        without having to stay in big dorm rooms.
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        Our room wasn't ready yet, so we headed to nearby Pub Street to get some
        food and beers.

        Cambodia has adopted USD as the country's de facto currency, so it's
        been really easy to pay for things. Most dishes on Pub Street are $5-6,
        but the standard price for a pint of draft Angkor beer at all of the
        bars and restaurants is $0.50! We have done our best to take advantage
        of the cheap beer!

        We weren't ready to venture to Angkor Wat yet, so we decided to sign up
        for a bike tour through the hostel.
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        We biked to a local village, which had a pretty temple and a very big
        pig roaming around.

      <div class="page-content-text">
        It started pouring while we were at the village, so we waited under the
        eaves of the temple for a little while. Eventually someone from the
        hostel brought some ponchos for us to continue our ride.

        The next stop on our bike tour was a lotus field. We watched our guide
        demonstrate lotus folding and had a beer to keep hydrated.

        We then sat in these floating huts as the sun set. It's definitely

        After our bike tour, we headed back to Pub Street to grab some food and

        After eating traditional Khmer food for lunch, we decided to try the
        Cambodian spin on doner kebab for dinner. It was a little sweeter than
        what we have had in Europe, but it was tasty!

        And embracing the sweetness of everything in Southeast Asia, we decided
        to get rolled ice cream from one of the many stands on Pub Street. It
        wasn't the best ice cream we've had, but it was a fun novelty. And we
        decided that making it would be a great way to keep our arms in shape!
