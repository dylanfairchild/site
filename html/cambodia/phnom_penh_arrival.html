        Before talking about what we did today, we thought it was getting crazy
        how much water we were buying. It really adds up when you are out
        sweating all day and cannot drink from the tap. Here is a picture of all
        of the big 1.5L bottles we had gone through for the room.

      <div class="page-content-text">
        To get from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh we decided to take a Giant Ibis bus.
        It went pretty smoothly and it was nice to dodge the airport for once
        when traveling.

      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        The bus had a couple pitstops where they let you out to stretch your
        legs or buy some food. Here is a picure from one of them, it is hard to
        see but there is actually a boat moving through a low river in the
        farmland. It looked pretty odd, since it looked like the boat was moving
        on land.

      <div class="page-content-text">
        Pretty much everywhere we went through on the bus was farmland, Cambodia
        is very rural.

        Once we arrived in Phnom Penh, we checked into our hotel which had an
        infinity-edge rooftop pool! Super cool!

        After checking out the pool, we went to "David's Homemade Noodles",
        which Steph had found on Trip Advisor. It was pretty cool because David
        was making the noodles right out front and you could watch as you were
        eating. The food was also excellent, some of the best noodles we have
        had. They also brought stuff so you could mix your own spice with garlic
        for your soup / dumplings etc.

        They also served a Cambodian Whisky, which we decided to try. I assume
        it was served as a whisky and water, since that is what it tasted like
        and the serving size was about right for that. It tasted pretty standard
        otherwise.
