      <div class="page-content-text">
        After doing the sunrise short circuit tour of the temple complex, we
        decided to sign up for the sunset "grand tour" the next day. This tour
        was more informal and didn't have a guide, but we shared a tuk-tuk with
        another couple from the hostel.
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        Here's the view of the patio area outside of the hostel where we waited
        for the tuk-tuk.

        The first temple on our grand tour was Preah Khan. Even before we got to
        the temple, though, we saw some cool statues and a big, creepy bug.

        We saw a ton of carvings of half-bird, half-man creatures that we later

      <div class="page-content-text">
        As we were looking at the inside of the temple, a Cambodian police
        officer...or at least someone wearing a Cambodian police
        uniform...started to tell us a little bit about the temple. He then said
        he would take our photo and held out his hand for my phone. I was a
        little unsure but hoped for the best and handed over my phone. It turns
        out that, in doing so, we had unintentionally hired ourselves a
        photographer for a mini photo shoot inside the temple. He took us all
        around the temple and had us pose in various locations. And of course,
        he made sure that we gave him a $2 tip for his troubles. The photos
        turned out pretty good and I got my phone back, so I say this was more
        of a win than a scam!

        Afterwards, we explored the area outside the back of the temple. I think
        the giant trees were one of the best parts of a lot of these temples.

        At this point, we discovered that even though we didn't have a tour
        guide, our tuk-tuk driver was on-track to take us to another expensive
        restaurant outside the last temple. Luckily, the couple that we were
        sharing a tuk-tuk with were on the same page as us, and we refused the

        tourist-trap restaurant. Before too long, though, he showed up and we

        Ultimately, we found a great spot at one of the restaurants on Pub

        terrible that they were great. I had to get a photo with them to
        document the experience before we called it a night.
