        Since we had been so busy for the last few days, and we were getting
        some requests for pictures from the moms and grandmoms, we decided to
        take a slow day to get the last set of posting done and relax by the
        pool.
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        That started off with walking through the pouring rain to lunch, the
        rain never lasted too long (10-15 minutes per shower) but really came
        down hard when it was raining.

        We walked back to Pub Street for dinner and ate at a restaurant there,
        not one of our favorite places since Steph got attacked by a bunch of
        big bugs that had come out after the rain multiple times throughout the
        meal. They kept smacking off of her face and falling on her, funnier for
        me than her.
