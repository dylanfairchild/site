        After just two days in Hanoi, we departed for Ho Chi Minh City, also
        known as Saigon. It wasn't quite as hot and chaotic as Hanoi, which was
        a welcome relief at first. But we surprisingly found ourselves missing
        the chaos of Hanoi after a little bit.

        We spent our first day eating and drinking and exploring.

      <div class="page-content-text">
        We saw the "Avenger's Tower" building on our way to the Ben Thanh
        Market.

        We were bombarded with lots of requests to buy stuff at the market, but
        we avoided any attempts at haggling.

        Near the market, we ate some pho at Pho 2000, which apparently Bill
        Clinton ate at. After the egg coffee in Hanoi, we decided that we were
        essentially on a presidential tour of Vietnam.

        Next, we went to check out the first craft brewery in Vietnam, Pasteur
        Street Brewing. The food and beer at this place were so good that we
        didn't mind that they charged US prices. We may have even returned to
        this place the next day...

        From the brewery, we walked through the center of District 1 of Ho Chi

        My favorite, though, was watching a super cute (and pretty fat) wiener

        Next, we tried another craft brewery, Bia Craft, that wasn't as good as
        Pasteur Street Brewing. But we got a great view of rush hour traffic
        from where wewere sitting on the second floor.

        We were pretty tired and decided to head back to our hotel, but we

        And we discovered that the "Backpacker's Street" that our hotel was on
        had turned into something resembling the Las Vegas strip on steriods
