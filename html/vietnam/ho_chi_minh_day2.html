        We started off our second day in Ho Chi Minh with a little exercise at
        the park near our hotel.

      <div class="page-content-text">
        After attempting to keep our arms in shape, we headed to the War
        Remnants Museum, which documents what we know in the US as the Vietnam
        War.
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        We hadn't eaten anything yet and had to take our malaria pills, so we
        went to the tourist-trap cafe outside the museum. The food looked good,
        but it wasn't all that great. Every other meal on our trip has been a
        success so far, though!

      <div class="page-content-text">
        Here we are at the museum! They had a bunch of old planes and
        helicopters outside, which was pretty cool.

      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        The mood and message of the rest of the museum was much more somber,
        though. It was really interesting to get such a different perspective on
        the war than what is taught in US history classes.
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        They had a guillotine that was used during the war on display, along
        with a lot of pictures and descriptions of war crimes that were
        committed in this war of "American aggression."

        After the museum, we lightened our moods with a walk to the bright pink
        Ta Dinh Church.

        And after eating a not-so-tasty-banh mi before the museum, we decided to
        check out the banh mi stall that was featured in the Netflix
        <i>Street Food</i> show. We knew we had found the right place when we
        came across a bunch of people on motorbikes stopped in front of a small
        cart in an alley.
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        The cart owner didn't speak English, but luckily one of the other
        customers helped us order and pay. The banh mi we got here was
        delicious!

        After eating our banh mi, we visited the Ngọc Hoàng Pagoda. And we hung
        out with some giant catfish in the pond out front.

        On our way out, we came across one of the many outdoor barbers in Ho Chi
        Minh. Dylan didn't want to cheat on his amazing hairstylist though.

        We ended our day with an amazing dinner at a restaurant recommended by
        Cam Ly, one of Dylan's relatives who we met in Sweden but is originally
        from here. It was a great rec! And we had to skål/cheers to Kevin and
        Marie, who just got engaged back home!
