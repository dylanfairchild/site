        Important Preface: I wish we had more photos of Hanoi, but it turns out
        that surviving the streets of Hanoi required just about all of my
        concentration. Every street crossing seemed like a death-defying feat.
        But after a little getting used to dodging cars and motorbikes and
        getting dodged by lots more motorbikes, we became seasoned pros!
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        Here's a couple photos that give a hint of the busy streets filled with
        motorbikes and the sidewalks filled with people selling food.

        Ba Dinh Square and Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        The hotel concierge had suggested taking a car to visit the mausoleum
        and nearby West Lake, but Dylan and I decided that we were game to head
        out on foot...and we made it!
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        The mausoleum was closed, so we didn't get to go inside, but we got to
        check out the surrounding square and the house that Ho Chi Minh had
        lived in.
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        As we took pictures in the square, we watched an entire group of people
        trying to stand in the shade of a flagpole. The direct heat felt
        brutal...and it only got hotter later in the day!

      <div class="page-content-images">

        Next to Ho Chi Minh's house was the one pillar pagoda.

      <div class="page-content-header">West Lake and Tran Quoc Pagoda</div>

        Next, we adventured a little further to check out the West Lake and a
        bigger pagoda.
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        We happened upon a botanical gardens on the way. The $0.10 entrance fee
        was well worth the respite from the busy city streets. And we found more
        exercise equipment!

        After making it to the West Lake, we found the pagoda!

        Next on our agenda was checking out to Dong Xuan Market. Alas, I used
        all of my concentration on walking and surviving the heat and didn't get
        any photos. But I can report that you can buy a ton of stuff in Hanoi
        for really cheap! Sadly, no room for souvenirs in our bags.
      </div>
      <div class="page-content-text">
        I also failed to get photos of our lunch, but Dylan did get a picture of
        me trying egg coffee which is a Hanoi specialty. With help from our
        concierge, we found the original shop that started serving it in 1946!
        Our waiter wanted to talk with us to practice his English, and we
        learned from him that the shop served egg coffee at the recent Trump-Kim
        summit in Hanoi. So he is practically famous!

      <div class="page-content-text">
        Our total step count for the day was 20,934...but we think we should get
        credit for way more considering the heat.
